# Data Analysis and Plotting

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of scripts and notebooks focused on data analysis, visualization, and statistical exploration. The project demonstrates practical techniques for handling datasets, generating insightful visualizations, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.

The key objectives include:
- Cleaning and preprocessing raw datasets
- Performing statistical analysis and extracting insights
- Visualizing data using various charting techniques
- Automating data reporting and visualization pipelines

## Tools and Libraries
The project primarily utilizes the following Python libraries:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and mathematical transformations
- **Matplotlib**: Customizable 2D plotting and visualization
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization
- **Plotly**: Interactive and dynamic charts
- **SciPy**: Advanced statistical analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Data preprocessing and machine learning utilities (optional)

## Features
### Data Processing
- Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers
- Feature engineering and transformation
- Statistical summary and correlation analysis

### Visualization Techniques
- **Basic plots**: Line, bar, scatter, and histograms
- **Advanced statistical plots**: Box plots, violin plots, and KDE plots
- **Multi-dimensional visualizations**: Heatmaps, pair plots, and facet grids
- **Interactive charts**: Plotly-based interactive visualizations

### Statistical Analysis
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, skewness, kurtosis)
- Hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square tests)
- Regression analysis and trend modeling

## Usage
### Running the Scripts
To execute the data analysis pipeline:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/semajrd1/Data-Analysis-and-Plotting.git
cd Data-Analysis-and-Plotting
pip install -r requirements.txt
python analysis_script.py
